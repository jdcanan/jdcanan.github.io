# Wheel of !Fortune

I cloned this repository off of https://github.com/b3an5/wheel-of-fortune and am planning to modify it with two goals in mind: 

1 - I built a physical spinning wheel for my kids and I want to be able to play the game by spinning the actual wheel in our living room, rather than the digital wheel that was created as part of the original repository

2 - I'm dusting off my coding skills and learning how to use Github + Github Pages, using this project as an excuse to do so :-) Once I've figured out the basics, I want to teach my kids how to use this too!

This project is a web-based Wheel of Fortune game designed for three players where players try to guess letters in a randomly generated puzzle while spinning a wheel to determine the point value for each letter. There are four rounds and an additional bonus round for the player with the highest score after the first four rounds. The main objective of this project was to design a game implementing OOP patterns with classes and methods following SRP. Additionally we wanted to create an intuitive and engaging UI/UX.
